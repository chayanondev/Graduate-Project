# Air Traffic Data Analysis for Airspace Complexity Assessment
## Abstract
In the present, air transportation is an essential form of transportation and it’s also one of the most
important factors in developing country’s competitive advantage. Airspace system and Air Traffic
Management (ATM) are keys to provide an efficient and safe air traffic services in Thailand. Growing
rapidly, the density and complexity of air traffic are so great that air traffic management may exceed
human capacity and cause delays and breach of safety. Therefore, it must be controlled and managed
systematically.

The objective of this project is to analyze the complexity of air traffic in order to support the design
of airspace, support increasing air traffic, and make Thailand's air transport safer and more efficient.

Comparison of the complexity of each indicator.The complexity measurements obtained from the
three indicators are consistent and the complexity values tend to go in the same direction. The
complexity measured in each indicator can be used to support air traffic management, such as dividing
airspace into sectors to reduce complexity, comparing which airspace is more complex to determine if
a new airspace can be designed to reduce complexity and new airspace design can use complexity
values to assess whether the design is effective.

## Objectives

⚡To explain the complexity of air traffic.

⚡To use air traffic data to analyze the complexity of the airspace to guide the design of the airspace more efficiently.

⚡To plot the complexity values from the different indicators in each period and compare the complexity values obtained in each indicator.

## Scopes

⚡Study the complexity of the airspace in Thailand.

⚡Study air traffic data from Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) data.

⚡Study the complexity of the airspace in the En-route airspace.

## Theory

⚡Hourly Entry Count

⚡Occupancy Count

⚡Dynamic Density
